# QRSqrtWithPTX
Quake III Fast Inverse Square Root Algorithm with inline PTX instructions

This repository includes an implimentation of the fast inverse square root algorithm from Quake III using inline PTX (Parallel Thread eXecution) instructions to manage registers on a CUDA GPU. The orginal Quake III algorithm includes type casting a pointer to a memeory address from a float to a long without modifying the data at the memory address. This project handles the type casting when data is loaded into registers from memory, and stored back in memory.
 
This project was additionally a test of using a local LLM as a coding tool. In particular, I used gemma-3-12b-it 4 bit Q4_K_M quantization as a guff with a size of 7gb in LM Studio. This model seemed to be a good fit for my RTX 4080 Super with 16gb of vram. The code generated by the LLM needed to be tweaked before being useful, but the  generated code samples were very helpful for styling, and asking the model follow up questions greatly helped in completing this project.

## Test Enviroment

- CUDA 12.8
- NVIDIA RTX 4080 Super

## Building and Running
